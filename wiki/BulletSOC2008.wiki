#summary Bullet 3D game physics library, GSOC 2008 idea page

= Introduction =

Google Summer of Code encourages students to participate in open source projects, and Bullet open source project is interested in participating as organization.

= Some ideas =

  * Add NVIdia CUDA support to accelerate parts of Bullet using graphics hardware (GPGPU)
  * Add SAT convex collision detection (see http://code.google.com/p/bullet/issues/detail?id=31)
  * Bring the Nima Maya exporter in a useable state: add Bullet support and replace FCollada by COLLADA-DOM
  * Add Featherstone constraint solver implementation
  * See the outstanding issue list for more ideas
