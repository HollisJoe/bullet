#summary Bullet 3D game physics library, GSOC 2008 idea page

= Introduction =

Google Summer of Code encourages students to participate in open source projects, and Bullet open source project is interested in participating as organization.

= Some ideas =

  * Add NVidia CUDA support to accelerate parts of Bullet using graphics hardware (GPGPU)
  * Add SAT convex collision detection, see http://code.google.com/p/bullet/issues/detail?id=31
  * Add [http://code.google.com/p/bullet/issues/detail?id=36 kinematic character controller], based on convexSweepTest
  * Integrating Bullet collision detection into Open Dynamics Engine (ODE)
  * Add support for [http://code.google.com/p/bullet/issues/detail?id=21 multiple broadphases] to support larger simulation worlds
  * Add one-shot contact generation, see [http://code.google.com/p/bullet/issues/detail?id=20 details]
  * Bring Maya Nima physics plugin in a useable state: add Bullet support and replace FCollada by COLLADA-DOM, see [http://bulletphysics.com/Bullet/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=1611 discussion]
  * Add Featherstone constraint solver implementation
  * See the outstanding [http://code.google.com/p/bullet/issues/list issue list] for more ideas
